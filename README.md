This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was built using various online resources for learning and with help from instructors and peers through out my bootcamp. A key source was https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-game-from-scratch-using-react/ which was referenced frequently for game logic.
